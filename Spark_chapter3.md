# Chapter 3: Programming with RDDs

A Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is simply a distributed collection of elements. In Spark, everything we do is about creating RDDs, transforming RDDs, or performing some operations on RDDs to get a result.  
The RDDs can contain and manipulate any type of data, even user created objects. In our previous examples, we were manipulating RDDs of strings.
